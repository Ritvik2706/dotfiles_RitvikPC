# NOTE:
# This is not actually a script, just gave it .sh name for syntax highlighting
# SSH host mappings for quick tmux session creation

# Example SSH hosts - customize these for your actual servers
# Format: hostname="key"
# The key is just for remembering keyboard shortcuts

# Personal servers (examples - customize or remove)
# homeserver="h"
# vps="v"
# raspberry="r"

# Work servers (examples - customize or remove)
# production="p"
# staging="s"  
# development="d"

# NOTE: If you don't use SSH hosts, you can leave this file empty
# or comment out all entries
